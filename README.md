# Guard::EJS

My first gem, and one of my first Ruby projects, so I'll take any help I can get.
Still a work in progress, and I'm using this for a side project that I'm working on right now.

TODO: Write the compiled templates file in a smarter way that doesn't overwrite
the entire thing every time you make a change.
